## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Using HTML and CSS. Also learnt to optimise my CSS properties

### Continued development

Since this was built with simple HTML and CSS, would like to shift to using React and adding some interactivity in the future

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_center-vertical.asp) - This helped me with centering a div without using margins
